This exercise diverges from the example built in the previous topics in this section. Rather than adding a frontend to the running example, this guide walks you through setting up dApp Kit in a React App. You can connect to wallets and query data from Sui RPC nodes to display in your app. You can use this to create your own frontend for the example used previously, but if you want to get a fully functional app up and running quickly, run the following command in a terminal or console to scaffold a new app with all steps in this exercise already implemented:

```sh
$ pnpm create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

or

```sh
$ yarn create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

## What is the Sui TypeScript SDK?

The Sui TypeScript SDK (@mysten/sui) provides all the low-level functionality needed to interact with the Sui ecosystem from TypeScript. You can use it in any TypeScript or JavaScript project, including web apps, Node.js apps, or mobile apps written with tools like React Native that support TypeScript.

For more information on the Sui TypeScript SDK, see the [Sui TypeScript SDK documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript).

## What is dApp Kit?

dApp Kit (@mysten/dapp-kit-react) is a collection of React hooks, components, and utilities that make building apps on Sui straightforward. For more information on dApp Kit, see the [dApp Kit documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit).

## Installing dependencies

To get started, you need a React app. The following steps apply to any React app, so you can follow the same steps to add dApp Kit to an existing React app. If you are starting a new project, you can use Vite to scaffold a new React app.

Run the following command in your terminal or console, and select React as the framework, and then select a TypeScript template:

```sh npm2yarn
$ npm init vite
```

Now that you have a React app, you can install the necessary dependencies to use dApp Kit:

```sh npm2yarn
$ npm install @mysten/sui @mysten/dapp-kit-react @tanstack/react-query
```

## Setting up Provider components

To use all the features of dApp Kit, wrap your app with the `DAppKitProvider` component.

Open the root component that renders your app (the default location the Vite template uses is `src/main.tsx`) and integrate or replace the current code with the following.

First, create a dApp Kit instance using `createDAppKit`. This configures which networks your app supports and how to create clients for each network.

```ts

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const dAppKit = createDAppKit({
	networks: ['devnet', 'mainnet'],
	defaultNetwork: 'devnet',
	createClient(network) {
		return new SuiGrpcClient({
			network,
			baseUrl:
				network === 'mainnet'
					? 'https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443'
					: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
		});
	},
});

// Register types for TypeScript support
declare module '@mysten/dapp-kit-react' {
	interface Register {
		dAppKit: typeof dAppKit;
	}
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		
			<DAppKitProvider dAppKit={dAppKit}>
				
			</DAppKitProvider>
		
	</React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## Connecting to a wallet

With the `DAppKitProvider` set up, you can use dApp Kit hooks and components. To allow users to connect their wallets to your app, add a `ConnectButton`.

```ts

function App() {
	return (
		
			<header className="App-header">
				
			</header>
		
	);
}
```

The `ConnectButton` component displays a button that opens a modal when clicked, enabling the user to connect their wallet. Upon connection, the component displays their address and provides the option to disconnect.

## Getting the connected wallet address

Now that you have a way for users to connect their wallets, you can start using the `useCurrentAccount` hook to get details about the connected wallet account.

```ts

function App() {
	return (
		
			<header className="App-header">
				
			</header>

			
		
	);
}

function ConnectedAccount() {
	const account = useCurrentAccount();

	if (!account) {
		return null;
	}

	return Connected to {account.address};
}
```

## Querying data from Sui RPC nodes

Now that you have the account to connect to, you can query for objects the connected account owns. Use the `useCurrentClient` hook to get the Sui client, and combine it with TanStack Query's `useQuery` hook for data fetching:

```ts

function ConnectedAccount() {
	const account = useCurrentAccount();

	if (!account) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		
			<div>Connected to {account.address};
			
		</div>
	);
}

function OwnedObjects({ address }: { address: string }) {
	const client = useCurrentClient();
	const { data } = useQuery({
		queryKey: ['ownedObjects', address],
		queryFn: () => client.core.listOwnedObjects({ owner: address }),
	});

	if (!data) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		
			{data.objects.map((object) => (
				<li key={object.objectId}>
					<a href={`https://example-explorer.com/object/${object.objectId}`}>
						{object.objectId}
					</a>
				</li>
			))}
		
	);
```

You now have an app connected to wallets and can query data from RPC nodes.
